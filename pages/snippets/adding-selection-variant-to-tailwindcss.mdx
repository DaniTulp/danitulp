# Adding a ::selection variant to Tailwind

[Adding variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/pseudo-class-variants#creating-custom-variants) to Tailwind is a piece of 🍰. Variants are a way to create custom pseudo-classes. Tailwind has the commonly used ones added by default, like hover and focus.

Let's explore how we can add one for the `::selection` pseudo-class. The `::selection` pseudo-class controls what happens to the element when you, well, select it. There are only three CSS properties that will work with `::selection`.
- `color`
- `background`
- `text-shadow`

Add this snippet to add & enable the variant:

```js:tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require("tailwindcss/plugin");

module.exports = {
  variants: {
    // Enable the variant for the `backgroundColor` & `textColor` properties
    backgroundColor: ["responsive", "hover", "focus", "active", "selection"],
    textColor: ["responsive", "hover", "focus", "active", "selection"],
  },
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ addVariant, e }) {
      addVariant("selection", ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {
        modifySelectors(({ className }) => {
          return `.${e(`selection${separator}${className}`)}::selection`;
        });
      });
    }),
  ],
};

```
To use the variant you add the `selection:` prefix to the text and/or background color like so:
```html:template
<p class="selection:bg-yellow-900 selection:text-yellow-600">Select me!</p>
```
<p className="selection:bg-yellow-900 selection:text-yellow-600">Select me!</p>

And that was it! I hope it was useful.
